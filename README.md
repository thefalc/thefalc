# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thefalc

My name is Sean Falconer, I am Confluent's AI Entrepreneur in Residence. Prior to Confluent, I led marketing and developer relations at Skyflow, lead developer experience for
Googleâ€™s Business Communications product suite, founded Proven.com and I was a Postdoctoral student in Bioinformatics at Stanford University.

I consider myself a generalist, Iâ€™ve been programming and hacking on things since I was a kid. Iâ€™ve worked on everything from web, Android and iOS, chatbots, and desktop apps,
to applications of data mining, ML and information visualization. While in university, I was a competitive programmer, competing twice in the ICPC World Programming Finals.

In my prior academic life, I published articles on a wide range of subjects including quantum computing, semantic web, computational geometry, string topology, and bioinformatics. I also taught classes at university in Human Computer Interaction, algorithms, and data structures.
I love to connect with people to talk about technology, so if you have questions, youâ€™re interested in chatting, or perhaps think my advice might be worth your time,
donâ€™t be shy and hit me up.
